                <h2> Mission Statement </h2>
                <p> 
                    EcoLife was conceived as a way to both inform and motivate people to take action against climate change. The members of our team recall only boring, drawn-out lectures from our days learning about climate change in school. We thought to ourselves, "climate change is important and all, but what is the point?". 
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    We were confused. Why were we learning something that could not be changed? Why do we need to be invested in something that is inevitable? Why care?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Then, it finally struck us. It wasn't that we couldn't do anything about climate change, but rather, we didn't know what we could do. We were taught how scary and dangerous climate change is, but not how easy it is to make a difference. This is when our team decided to create EcoLife.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    EcoLife is meant to inform the one thing we wish we were taught in school: how to make a difference. We believe that once people find out how easy and satisfying it is to save the world one step at a time, they will do it. And keep doing it. Over, and over again. When all of us make small differences, the world change a whole lot.

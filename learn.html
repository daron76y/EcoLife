                    Climate change means long-term changes in temperature and weather patterns on Earth induced primarily through human activities such as gas emissions, deforestation, or fossil fuel combustion. In doing so, greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane are emitted and held in the atmosphere, thereby serving as heat-trapping gases that increase global temperatures. One clear manifestation of the pressing climate change problem is droughts' increasing frequency and intensity, occurring where once productive land has become dry and cracked soil, as represented in the figure above. In addition, sea levels are rising from glacier and polar ice cap melting due to global warming, threatening coastal ecosystems and livelihoods.

                    Climate change can be said to cause many things; one of them is polar ice caps and glacier melting. The cause of these changes is save mostly temperature elevation of Earth, which goes hand in hand with greenhouse gases' emissions. Surface temperatures have climbed massively giving in rapid ice mass loss from both Arctic and Antarctic regions. This escalates sea-level rise, putting at risk the stability of various coastal regions and culturally displacing millions. Species such as polar bears are further threatened as they depend on stable platforms of ice to support hunting. Besides, ocean currents and weather patterns are disrupted even more by the increasing barrage of extreme weather phenomena, which in their path send greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. We must stop the emissions right away, protect this ecosystem, and then, if not, we'll all bear the costs...real quick!

                <h2> Pollution </h2>

                    Pollution entails the introduction of harmful and unnatural substances into the environment as a result of disastrous impacts on ecosystems, human health, and the Earth. Every time some industrial effluents are released into the natural resources of air, water, and soil, pollution occurs. Pollution is caused by chemical spills, plastic litter, and emission of greenhouse gases from vehicles and factories. Non-biodegradable wastes piled up in landfills will leak their toxic substances and methane gas further into the environment in order to constitute pollution. Deforestation and its poor management add insult to injury. Pollution is mainly caused by human activities spurred by urbanization, these include industrialization and the usage of non-biodegradable packaging for our products. These activities interfere with ecosystems and aggravate climate changes; thus they are considered an imminent threat to the environment.

                    Microplastics are minute plastic particles below 5mm in size which result from the disintegration of larger plastic waste. The disintegration process is influenced by solar radiation, violent agitation due to water waves, and erosion or weathering, as well as from synthetic fibers discharged from apparel during washing. These microscopic plastic fragments have disastrous effects on the environment and life on planet Earth. In particular, due to their size, microplastics are often mistaken for food by marine organisms, thereby leading to obstruction of their bodies, the exposure to toxic plastic components, and nutritional deficiencies. The subsequent upward transfer of microplastics within the food chain exposes human consumers to health hazards via the ingestion of microplastic-laden meat with risks of hormonal interference and possible organ toxicity. Further, microplastics also erode soil quality and have been discovered in remote sites, further establishing their environmental prevalence.

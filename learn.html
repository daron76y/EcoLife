                    Climate change is the long-term alteration of temperature and weather patterns on Earth, largely caused by human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and gas emissions. These processes release greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane which trap heat within the atmosphere, causing global temperatures to rise. As seen in the photo above, a common danger of climate change is the increased frequency and severity of droughts, as seen in areas where once fertile land have turned into dry cracked soil. Additionally, rising global temperatures are contributing to the melting of polar ice caps and glaciers, leading to rising sea levels that threaten coastal ecosystems and human communities.

                <p>
                    The melting of polar ice caps and glaciers is a major consequence of climate change that is, at its core, driven by rising global temperatures due to greenhouse gases. As the Earth's surface warms, giant ice sheets in the Arctic and Antarctic are rapidly melting away. This phenomenon contributes to the rising sea levels, which threatens to submerge coastal regions and displace millions of people. The melting of ice also endangers wildlife such as polar bears, who rely on stable ice platforms for hunting prey. Furthermore, the disruption of ocean currents and weather patterns leads to more extreme weather events, while the release of methane from melting ice accelerates global warming. Without immediate efforts to reduce emissions and protect these vulnerable ecosystems, the consequences will continue to increase at an accelerating rate, posing a significant threat to life on Earth.

                    Pollution is the introduction of harmful unnatural substances into the environment, causing disastrous effects on ecosystems, human health, and the planet. It happens whenever natural resources such as air, water, and soil are contaminated by industrial waste, chemical spills, plastic litter, and the emission of greenhouse gases from vehicles and factories. Landfills, which are often filled with non-biodegradable waste, release toxic chemicals and methane gas that further pollute the environment. Deforestation and poor waste management further deepen the problem. The main causes of pollution are human activities driven by urbanization, industrialization, and the usage of non-biodegradable packaging for our products. These activities disrupt ecosystems and contribute to climate change, posing a major threat to the environment.

                    Microplastics are tiny plastic particles measuring less than 5 millimeters in size, coming from the degradation of larger plastic waste. The breakdown of plastic materials occurs through prolonged exposure to sunlight, water waves, and erosion/weathering, as well as from synthetic fibers shed from clothing during laundry. These microscopic plastic fragments have a devastating impact on the environment and life on Earth. In particular, marine animals often mistake microplastics for food, leading to physical blockages in their body, exposure to plastic toxins, and nutrient deficiencies. As microplastics move up the food chain, they pose health risks to humans who consume meat contaminated with microplastics, including hormonal disruptions and potential organ damage. Additionally, microplastics harm soil quality and have been found in remote locations, showcasing their widespread environmental presence.
